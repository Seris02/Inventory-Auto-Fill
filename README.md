# Inventory Auto Fill
Not much to mention here, it just adds a few keybinds so that you can autofill from your inventory to other GUIs, like chests and stuff. And vice versa too.
Also, I couldn't figure out the packets code, so thanks reo-ar and Inventory Tweaks Renewed, I kinda copied your packets code.
